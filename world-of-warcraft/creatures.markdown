## [creature](https://trinitycore.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/tc/pages/2130150/game\+tele)
All spawned creatures(NPCs) are saved into creature table.
A few of these fields are also repeated in table creature_template (we are going to explain about the creature_template table later)
But remember all data from creature table will overwrite the data on the creature_template table.
For example, We have an NPC with flag = 5 on creature_template. Now if we change the NPC flag to 8 in creature table. The value of that flag will be 8 in the end.

| Fields | Information |
| ------ | ------ |
| guid   | (Primary key) This is a unique number for each spawned creature and we can address the creatures using GUID. **guid can be different to one realm to other** Because as I told you before core will fill the GUID value.
|   Id   | This is the entry of the NPC. You can find it using.NPC info or in WoWhead. For example, http://www.wowhead.com/npc=56041 Id=56041.
|Map| You can find the map number using .gps command in-game.
