# Creatures

## Creatures Table

All spawned creatures (non-player characters) are saved into creature table. A few of these fields are also repeated in table creature_template (we are going to explain about the creature_template table later).

But remember all data from creature table will overwrite the data on the creature_template table. For example, We have an NPC with flag = 5 on creature_template. Now if we change the NPC flag to 8 in creature table. The value of that flag will be 8 in the end.

| Field | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| guid   | (Primary key) This is a unique number for each spawned creature and we can address the creatures using GUID. **guid can be different in each realm/server** As explained before GUID is auto-fill and you can just leave this field NULL.|
|   Id   | This is the entry of the NPC. You can find it using.NPC info or in WoWhead. For example, http://www.wowhead.com/npc=56041 Id=56041.|
|Map| You can find the map number using .gps command in-game.|
|Spawnmask| Controls under which difficulties the creature is spawned. And you can combine the values here. For example, 2+8=10 so if you put 10 here the npc will be spawned in 25 normal and heroic modes.|
|phasemask| This field describes all the phases that a creature will appear in. You can change the play's phase by spells. For example, If you get targeted with a spell to change your phase to 1 you only will see NPCs in phase 1, If you're in phase 3, you will see NPCs in phase 2 and phase 1(2+1=3). http://www.wowhead.com/spell=55782/phase-shift-1-foote-steppes|
|Modelid| ModelID/MorphID of the NPC|
|Equipment_id| |(Foreign key) this field can link your table to |
|Position_x, position_y, position_z| |The exact position of the creature in-game.|
|Spawntimesecs| |The spawn time of the creature (In seconds)|
|Spawndist| |The maximum distance for the creature to walk around with random movements(only works if the creature has MovementType = 1 in creature table or creature_template table)|
|curhealth| |The health that the creature will spawn with.|
|curmana| |The mana that the creature will spawn with.|
|MovementType| |There are 3 possible numbers for this field. 0= the NPC will just stay and wonâ€™t move, 1=Random movement and 2= Waypoint movement: The NPC will move in a specified line|
