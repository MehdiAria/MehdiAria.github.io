# Creatures

## Creatures Table

All spawned creatures (non-player characters) are saved into creature table. A few of these fields are also repeated in table creature_template (we are going to explain about the creature_template table later).

But remember all data from creature table will overwrite the data on the creature_template table. For example, We have an NPC with flag = 5 on creature_template. Now if we change the NPC flag to 8 in creature table. The value of that flag will be 8 in the end.

## CREATURE_TEMPLATE Table.
This template table has whole the data about one creatures. When you want to add npc with creature table or in-game you have to make sure if the creature existing in this table. Creature_template is a template for creatures you spawn them in creature table. When you spawn a creature in-game or with creature table they inherit their field values from creature_template. But if you change anything on creatures table this will be overwritten for that specified creature with specified GUID.
